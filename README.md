# Kmip Open Source
 
 
I am researching Key Management Solutions in order to become PCI compliant. I have spoken to a number of vendors in the arena, and while I like their products, the cost is beyond my budget. Is anyone aware of any open source or low cost solutions for Key Management? I use a Windows/.NET environment, so I would prefer solutions that target that environment, however I would be interested in hearing about anything that is out there.

We had a similar experience as you. We needed a key management solution for PCI compliance and all the commercial products we saw were too expensive. Some key managers cost more than our product for small customers!
 
We ended up making a software based key manager. We made requirements and offshore developers coded it. At one time they were looking for other customers to use it. I don't know if they still are or not.
 
Option 0 - Assign a key per DB column, and store keys in a DLL file. Your application links in the DLL file to access the keys to encrypt and decrypt the data. No one knows the keys. For periodic key replacement you make a new DLL with new keys, take down time to decrypt all data using old keys and reencrypt data using new keys. Then restart your application using the new DLL with new keys. (Note if you ever consider restoring a DB backup, you need to keep the old keys.)
 
If you have an HSM in your environment, use the HSM to encrypt the keys in the DLL file. When your application starts it will decrypt the keys using the HSM. If you want more security, decrypt the keys every time they are needed.

Once your keys are encrypted, it is safe to store them in a DB table. If you assign each key (old and new) a small integer key-id, you can store the key-id with the encrypted data. That lets you do incremental key replacement and avoid down time.
 
Having your keys in the clear in memory in lots of processes, increases your exposure to a memory scan attack finding the keys. You can create a new process that is the only process that decrypts the keys. Your applications talks to this new process to encrypt and decrypt data. This new process should be on a box with a small "surface area" to protect it. Since sensitive data is going over the network now, this communications should be encrypted. SSL is a good option.
 
However, there are many advantages with option #2 as it allows you to leverage Public Clouds while being fully PCI-compliant (search for "Regulatory Compliant Cloud Computing (RC3)" and click on the link at IBM - I can only post two links in my answer) with more announcements about how to leverage this appliance being announced at RSA 2013 in San Francisco.
 
So I am exploring some options about database encryption. The best options are commercial (TDE). I am looking for an open-source implementation. Recent releases of MySQL and MariaDB have data-at-rest capabilities:
 
The MariaDB file\_key\_management plugin enables the configuration of keys in a file. The key file is read at system start and no additional access is needed during runtime. The security of the encryption depends on access restriction to the key file. The key file can itself be encrypted, providing additional layer of protection.
 
From my point of view this will mean providing the decryption of the key during start (and OS reboot)? So whenever we (re-)boot a system does this mean we need to manually provide this key? Having this key readable on the server itself will defeat the use of data-at-rest encryption in the first place.
 
The InnoDB tablespace encryption feature in non-enterprise editions of MySQL use the keyring\_file plugin for encryption key management, which is not intended as a regulatory compliance solution. Security standards such as PCI, FIPS, and others require use of key management systems to secure, manage, and protect encryption keys in key vaults or hardware security modules (HSMs).
 
MySQL Enterprise Edition offers the keyring\_okv plugin, which includes a KMIP client (KMIP v1.2) that works with Oracle Key Vault (OKV) to provide encryption key management. A secure and robust encryption key management solution such as OKV is critical for security and for compliance with various security standards. Among other benefits, using a key vault ensures that keys are stored securely, never lost, and only known to authorized key administrators. A key vault also maintains an encryption key history.
 
Now I am wondering, can this be made compliant with security standards? When using this data-at-rest, will root or mysql user have access to the keys since they could read encryption keys from memory?
 
**Storage encryption can be performed at the file system level or the block level. Linux file system encryption options include eCryptfs and EncFS, while FreeBSD uses PEFS. Block level or full disk encryption options include dm-crypt + LUKS on Linux and GEOM modules geli and gbde on FreeBSD. Many other operating systems support this functionality, including Windows.**
 
This mechanism prevents unencrypted data from being read from the drives if the drives or the entire computer is stolen. This does not protect against attacks while the file system is mounted, because when mounted, the operating system provides an unencrypted view of the data. However, to mount the file system, you need some way for the encryption key to be passed to the operating system, and sometimes the key is stored somewhere on the host that mounts the disk.
 
Yes, that means you have a key. Yes, that means if the key is compromised the data can be read. But if your database is compromised and not the key, the data is secure. And, that's why it's data-at-rest.
 
So you normally store the key owned by root. Have root mount the secured location, and let the postgres user access that. Obviously PostgreSQL needs access to the data and has to know how to decrypt it.
 
Now, if other users are on the machine they can't access the data unless they're they postgres user. Moreover, they can't access the key. And if they do manage to compromise the data or even steal the physical encrypted back up they can't access it without the key.
 
Since v 5.7.20, (free) Percona now offers Data encrytion at rest using keys stored in a (free) remote HashiCorp Vault server. Documentation is not really easy to follow, but even I managed to have it running.
 
So would you like a free solution for your business critical application and data? MySQL provides a free solution, but the key file is stored on the same place where the data is. PostgreSQL also provides a free solution and encrypts the whole partition/disk, but when the server is under attack it doesn't provide a safe solution because the user can read the mounted disk and its data. It is a risk so you should store the encryption key in a safe place. I think the question where this safe place is and who will protect it without any money. My opinion is that, you won't find such a solution.
 
The Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) is a single, comprehensive protocol for communication between clients that request any of a wide range of encryption keys and servers that store and manage those keys. By replacing redundant, incompatible key management protocols, KMIP provides better data security while at the same time reducing expenditures on multiple products.
 
KMIP Profiles v2.1 specifies conformance clauses that define the use of objects, attributes, operations, message elements and authentication methods within specific contexts of KMIP server and client interaction.
 
The Virtual Global Taskforce (VGT) has recommended the worldwide adoption of the OData standard developed by OASIS Open to enable much-needed compatibility among international law inforcement tools that help manage illicit images and video regardless of vendor. The result is an online environment in which young surfers are less likely to be exposed to inappropriate content.
 
Systems like these are enabled thanks to the open software and standards Open Oasis makes possible. Partnering with government, community and private industry players, OASIS Open helps to foster a common language and means of operation that allows such transformational systems to be put into place.
 
The fair, transparent development of open standards and software is transforming the world, for the better. As one of the most respected, non-profit standards bodies in the world, we are a cornerstone in the development and implementation of social innovations like the early warning systems for tsunamis, floods and tornadoes that save lives and communities.
 
The SAML standard developed by OASIS Open allows access to information to be enjoyed by all in Europe, where all citizens are legally entitled to it. As this complex web of information is gathered and stored by a multiplicity of players over a wide variety of channels in the private and public spheres, its management would simply not be possible without the standards set by organizations like ours.
 
UBL is just one of the open, fair, and transparent standards developed by our not-for-profit organization. Every day we create protocols and software that allow complex systems to be integrated across multiple geographies and a complex web of regulations and private and public stakeholders.
 
Work on the ESS began in 2017, when a number of nursing home residents died during power outages caused b Hurricane Irma. An application called RESTier was developed, powered by OData, to help collect vital information about healthcare facilities. This data was integrated into the ESS, which was activated for 24 months straight, handling tens of millions of records without a single documented outage.
